# EEG Seizure Classification for TSC Model

## Overview
This project aims to create a classifier to detect seizures for EEG data based on 30-second clips of recordings. The data used is EEG data collected from mouse models of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), which is a common cause of epilepsy in humans. The data was collected at the University of Vermont from TSC KO mice. The goal is to expedite the detection of seizures in new recordings in order to develop a better phenotype for this mouse model. Additional data is being collected in large volumes and requires a more efficient sorting method other than manual annotation.
